# form.html

This project is a basic HTML form designed to collect user input and provide a straightforward user experience. The form includes the following fields:

Name: A text field for the user's name.

Email: A field for the user's email address.

Contact: A field for the user's contact number.

Gender: A dropdown or radio buttons to select the user's gender.

Date of Birth: A date picker for the user's date of birth.

Rating: A star rating system (up to 5 stars) for users to review the form.

Message Box: A textarea for users to type a message or feedback. The form also includes two key buttons:

Submit: After filling out the form, clicking this button redirects the user to my GitHub profile. 

Reset: This button clears all the form fields, allowing the user to correct any mistakes before submitting. 

This project serves as a simple yet functional example of HTML form creation, and can be used as a starting point for more complex form-based applications.
